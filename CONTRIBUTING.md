# Contributing to Mainframe-Modernization

Thank you for your interest in this project. As an engineering-led initiative, we maintain high standards for code quality, security, and documentation.

## 🛠 Development Standards
* **Language Standards:** For Rust projects, all code must pass `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.
* **Testing:** No pull request will be merged without accompanying unit tests. We aim for high functional coverage.
* **Documentation:** All public functions must be documented. Architecture changes must be reflected in the README.

## 🚀 Pull Request Process
1. **Fork the Repo:** Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. **Commit Mentality:** Use imperative, descriptive commit messages (e.g., "Add AES-256 encryption to payment gateway").
3. **Review:** All PRs require a peer review (or a self-review checklist for personal projects) focusing on memory safety and logic.

## ⚖️ Code of Conduct
We follow professional standards of collaboration. By contributing, you agree to abide by our project's commitment to "Sophisticated Design and Quality Products."
